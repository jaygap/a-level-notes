# Call stack and Stack frames

A call stack is an area of memory that is allocated to a program to store information about each active subroutine. An active subroutine is one that has been called, but has not yet finished execution. At any point during a program's execution, there may be multiple active subroutines.

# High-level Languages

High-level languages are problem-oriented rather than machine-oriented, meaning that they are designed to handle specific types of problems rather than work on specific types of hardware.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---- | ---- |
| - Easier to write | - Less memory efficient than machine code |
| - Easier to learn |  |
| - Portable (can be compiled and run on different computer architectures) |  |
| - Come with libraries of functions, meaning programmers can make us of pre-written code |  |

## Types of high-level languages

### Imperative/procedural languages

Examples: 
- C
- Python
- FORTRAN

Code can be split up into procedures.

### Functional languages

Type of declarative language.

Data is immutable.

# Object-oriented Programming
