not doing them because they need diagrams and i dont know how to get them working on this software

# Telescopes

## Refracting Telescopes

- Use an objective lens with long focal length and an eyepiece lens with short focal length.
- The *normal adjustment* of a telescope is when the distance between the lenses is the same as the sum of their focal lengths.
- Angular magnification is when an object appears bigger by increasing the angle at which it enters the eye through a telescopes compared to the naked eye.
	- Angular magnification is calculated as $M = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}$ where $\beta$ is the angle of the virtual image from the telescope and $\alpha$ is the actual angle to the naked eye.
	- If both anglers are less than $10^o$ then the angular magnification, $M$ can be calculated with $M = \frac{\textrm{focal length of the objective lens}}{\textrm{focal length of the eyepiece lens}}$

## Reflecting Telescopes

- Use a large concave mirror in place of an objective lens but still have an eyepiece lens
- Newtonian reflecting telescope
	- The first kind of reflecting telescope
	- Use a large concave mirror for the objective, then a small plane mirror reflects the light into an eyepiece lens
- Cassegrain reflecting telescope
	- Use a large concave mirror with a hole in the centre, then a small convex mirror to reflect the light through the whole into an eyepiece lens
	- Smaller than a Newtonian telescope with the same collecting power
	- Focussing is done by adjusting the convex mirror that reflects light into the eyepiece lens

## Collecting Power

The collecting power of a telescope is a measure of how much energy per second it collects. It depends on the area of the objective and the intensity of the incident radiation.

$$\textrm{collecting power} \propto \textrm{area of the objective}$$

## Aberrations

### Spherical

- The objective mirror should be parabolic in shape and not spherical as a spherical mirror will not reflect light to a single focal point. When they are reflected to different focal points, spherical aberration happens.

### Chromatic

- Blue light is refracted more than red light so the focal length of red light is longer than that of blue light. This can cause white objects to appear to have colour around their edges.

## Comparing Telescopes

| Refracting | Reflecting |
| ---- | ---- |
|- Has a wider field of view than reflecting telescopes of the same length because they have a smaller angular magnification |- Has a secondary mirror and supports, which can block light|
|- Do not suffer from spherical aberration |- Can have much wider objectives because the mirror can be supported from below|
| |- Shorter and easier to handle than reflecting telescopes of the same magnification|
| |- Suffer less from chromatic aberration |

# Resolving Power

Telescopes do not produce perfectly crisp images because objective acts like a slit so it diffracts the light making images blurry.

## Rayleigh Criterion

The Rayleigh criterion states that the 2 point objects cannot be resolved (differentiated into 2 objects) if any part of the central maximum of one image lies inside the first minimum ring of the other image (if they are very close).

The minimum angular separation, $\theta$ that can be resolved is given by:

$$\theta = \frac{\lambda}{D}$$

Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and $D$ is the diameter of the aperture.

The lower the Rayleigh criterion, the better the resolution of an image.
