# Particles

## Exchange Particles
- Gluon - Strong Nuclear Force
- $W^{\pm} / Z$ - Weak Nuclear Force
- Photon - Electromagnetic Force
- Graviton - Gravitational Force

## Leptons

Leptons are fundamental particles meaning that they cannot be broken down any further.

Leptons also do not feel the strong force.

Particles:
- Electron $-$ $e^-$
- Electron-neutrino $-$ $v_{e}$
- Muon $-$ $\mu^-$
- Muon-neutrino $-$ $v_{\mu}$
- Tau $-$ $\tau^-$
- Tau-neutrino $-$ $v_{\tau}$

Anti-particles:
- Positron $-$ $e^+$
- Anti-electron-neutrino $-$ $\bar{v}_{e}$
- Anti-muon $-$ $\mu^+$
- Anti-muon-neutrino $-$ $\bar{v}_{\mu}$
- Anti-tau $-$ $\tau^+$
- Anti-tau-neutrino $-$ $\bar{v}_{\tau}$

Each lepton has a lepton no. of 1 and each anti-lepton has a lepton no. of -1

## Hadrons

Hadrons are particles that contain quarks.

### Quarks

Quarks - like leptons - are fundamental particles and cannot be broken down any further.

The known types are:
- Up ($u$)
- Down ($d$)
- Strange ($s$)
- Charm ($c$)
- Top ($t$)
- Bottom ($b$)

They also have their respective antiparticles equivalents.

### Baryons

Baryons are particles made of 3 quarks or anti quarks.

Examples:
- Proton $-$ $uud$
- Neutron $-$ $udd$
- Anti-proton - $\bar{u}\bar{u}\bar{d}$
- Anti-neutron - $\bar{u}\bar{d}\bar{d}$

Each baryon has a baryon no. of 1 and each anti-baryon has a baryon no. of -1

### Mesons

Mesons are particles made of a quark-antiquark pair.

Mesons have a baryon no. of 0 and lepton no. of 0

#### Pions

Pions are mesons that have no strangeness.

$\pi^+ = u\bar{d}$
$\pi^0 = u\bar{u}$  and $d\bar{d}$
$\pi^- = d\bar{u}$

#### Kaons

Kaons are mesons that have strangeness.

$K^+ = u\bar{s}$
$K^0 = d\bar{s}$ and $s\bar{d}$
$K^- = s\bar{u}$

## Conservation Laws

- Charge is always conserved
- Baryon no. is always conserved
- Lepton no. is always conserved
- Strangeness is ***not*** conserved in interactions due to the Weak Nuclear Force, but is otherwise conserved

# Electromagnetic Radiation & Quantum Phenomena

## Photoelectric Effect

When light above a certain frequency (called the threshold frequency) is shined on a metal plate, electrons can be liberated from the surface.

This is because for the electrons to be liberated, they need to receive a certain amount of energy, which is not affected by the intensity of the light, and only the energy of each photon (decided by its frequency). When the frequency of light is above the threshold frequency, then the intensity is proportional to the number of electrons emitted, as more high-energy photons means more electrons emitted.

### Einstein's Photon Model

Einstein came up with an explanation for the photoelectric effect, he suggested that light was made up of little packets of energy called photons.

He suggested that each photon had a one-on-one interaction with an electron in which the electron absorbs all the energy of one photon.

This explains why the intensity does not cause the electrons to be emitted, as no matter how many photons arrive per second each one only interacts with one electron - and if it doesn't have enough energy (frequency above the threshold frequency) then it wont be able to liberate an electron.

Energy and frequency are linked with the equation:
$$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
where $E$ is energy, $h$ is Planck's Constant, $f$ is frequency, $c$ is the speed of light and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

### Photoelectric equation

$$hf = \phi + E_{k(max)}$$
$\phi$ is the work function, the minimum energy needed to break free from the bonds in the metal (the energy achieved by the threshold frequency), $E_{k(max)}$ is the maximum kinetic energy of the electron.

Measuring the stopping potential, $V_s$ , can help work out the maximum kinetic energy. After an electron is emitted, it passes through an electric potential and must do work to move through it, $e \times V_s$.

The electrons will stop if all of their kinetic energy is used up doing work against the potential, so the equation for the stopping potential is $eV_s = E_{k(max)}$
