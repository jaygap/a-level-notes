## Hooke's Law
Hooke's law state that the extension of a string is directly proportional to the force applied.
$$F = k \Delta l$$
Where k is the spring constant and its units are $Nm^{-1}$
## Density
$$Density = \frac{Mass}{Volume}$$
## Tensile Stress
The force applied per unit cross-sectional area. Its unit is $Nm^{-2}$

$$\sigma = \frac{F}{A}$$
## Tensile Strain
A measure of how a material stretches. It has no units.
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l}$$
## Elastic vs Plastic Deformation
Elastic deformation - the object returns to its original shape when the force is removed.
Plastic deformation - the object does not return to its original shape when the force is removed

## Breaking Stress
The minimum stress needed to break a material.

## Brittleness
A material is described as brittle if it breaks instead of deforming plastically when the stress reaches a certain value.
## Elastic Limit
The force above which the material will be plastically deformed.
## Elastic Strain Energy
The equation for elastic strain energy is:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}k \Delta l^2$$
Where $E$ is energy, $k$ is the spring constant, and $\Delta l$ is the extension.
## Young's Modulus
Young's Modulus describes the stiffness of a material.
It is given by the equations: 
$$E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$$
$$E = \frac{FL}{\Delta LA}$$
On a stress-strain graph, the young's modulus is the gradient where the graph is still linear.
## Limit of proportionality
The point on a force-extension graph where Hooke's Law is no longer obeyed. This means that the relationship between force and extension is no longer linear.

## Force-Extension Graphs

Not all work done is stored as elastic strain energy when plastic deformation occurs as some energy is dissipated as heat.

### Vehicles and deformation
Crumple zones deform plastically in a crash using the car's kinetic energy so less is transferred to the passengers.

Seat belts stretch to convert the passenger's kinetic energy into elastic strain energy.

## Stress-Strain Graph
The highest point on a stress-strain graph is the maximum stress that material can withstand (ultimate tensile stress).

Below is a stress-strain graph that shows different types of materials.
