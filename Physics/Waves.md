## Transverse Waves
Transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to the propagation of energy.

Examples of transverse waves include electromagnetic waves.
## Longitudinal Waves
Longitudinal waves oscillate parallel to the propagation of energy.

Examples of transverse waves include sound waves.
## Wave Properties
**Frequency** - the number of oscillations per second (unit is Hz)
$$f = \frac{number \space of \space oscillations}{time}$$
$$f = \frac{1}{time \space period}$$
**Wavelength** - the distance between 2 points on a wave of equal displacement and velocity
**Amplitude** - the distance from the equilibrium position to the peak or trough of a wave.
**Time Period** - the time taken to complete 1 oscillation (unit is seconds)
$$T = \frac{1}{f}$$
## Phase Difference
The phase of wave describes how far through its cycle it is. It is measured in degrees or radians where $180^o$ or $2\pi$ radians is one complete cycle.

The phase difference of two waves is the difference in phase between the waves.

Phase difference can also be measured in fractions of a wave cycle where a full cycle is one wavelength ($\lambda$) and half a cycle would be $\frac{\lambda}{2}$.
## Polarisation
Polarised waves only oscillate along a single plane. Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised.

Polarisers only allow transverse waves to pass through at a particular angle. Polarisers are used in sunglasses and polaroid cameras.

If you place two polarisers at right angles to each other, then now waves will pass through.

Aerials can be oriented so that its spokes are aligned horizontally or vertically. This will determine what kind of polarised radio waves it can receive.

## Stationary Waves
A stationary wave is formed when two progressive waves with the same frequency and wavelength but moving in opposite directions interfere with each other.

Nodes are points of zero displacement from the equilibrium position. This means they are stationary.

Antinodes are points of maximum displacement from the equilibrium (max amplitude). They oscillate from the furthest point above the equilibrium to the furthest point below the equilibrium (peak to trough to peak).

Stationary waves can only happen at certain resonant frequencies. These frequencies occur when the distance between the two fixed ends is an integer multiple of $\frac{\lambda}{2}$. The first resonant frequency is called the first harmonic and it has 2 nodes at the fixed ends and an antinode in the middle.

The second harmonic occurs when the distance between the fixed points is one $\lambda$. It has 3 nodes and 2 antinodes.

The third harmonic occurs when the distance between the fixed points is $\frac{3 \lambda}{2}$. It has 4 nodes and 3 antinodes.

## Stationary Waves on a String (Practical)
The purpose of the practical is to investigate how the frequency of a stationary wave changes when its length ($L$), tension ($T$) or mass per unit length ($\mu$) are changed.

The equation relating frequency and these independent variables is:
$$f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$$
For the first harmonic as $\frac{1}{2}\lambda = L$.

As the length of the string increases, the frequency decreases.

As the tension increases, the frequency increases.

As the mass per unit length increases, frequency decreases.

## Interference
Interference happens when any two waves are superimposed over each other. The principle of superpositions states that when two waves overlap (superimpose) the displacement of the combined wave is the sum of the two waves that make it. Most superimposed waves create a messy wave pattern. 

To see a clearer interference pattern the waves must be coherent. This means that they must have the same frequency and wavelength and a fixed phase difference.

The path difference between two waves is the difference in length travelled by the waves to get to a certain point.

For two coherent wave source, if the path difference is a $n\lambda$ the waves will be in phase and constructive interference will occur. If the path difference is $(n + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$ where $n$ is a positive integer, then destructive interference will occur.

## Young's Double-Slit Experiment
To observe interference between two waves, we need two coherent sources. This can be achieved by pointing a laser (monochromatic and coherent) through two slits with very small distance between them. This causes both slits to act as their own sources of coherent waves which allows for interference effects to be shown.

The equation to calculate the fringe width is:
$$w = \frac{\lambda D}{s}$$
Where $w$ is the fringe width, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, $D$ is the distance from the slits to the screen the light is hitting and $s$ is the slit separation.

Using white light causes the middle fringe to be bright white and all other side fringes to show a spectrum of colours.
## Diffraction
Diffraction only occurs if the wavelength of the laser is roughly the same as the width of the single slit.

We expect to see a bright central fringe with alternating dark and bright bands (caused by the constructive and destructive interference).
## Refraction
Refraction occurs when light changes the medium it travels through. Materials have a refractive index , $n$, which is the ration of the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material $c_s$. It is given by:
$$n = \frac{c}{c_s}$$
The refractive index of air is approximately the same as the speed of light in a vacuum so.
$$c_{air} \approx c$$
### Snell's Law
$$n_1sin\theta_1=n_2sin\theta_2$$
Where $n_1$ is the refractive index of the material the light is originally in, $\theta_1$ is the angle of incidence, $n_2$ is the refractive index of the material the light is entering and $\theta_2$ is the angle of refraction.

When light travels from a less optically dense to a more optically dense medium, it bends towards the normal. If light travels from a more optically dense medium to a less optically dense one, it bends away from the normal.

When light travels from a medium with a high refractive index to a medium with a low refractive index, there is an angle where the light is entirely reflective. This is called the critical angle and it is given by:
$$sin\theta_c=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
Where $n_2$ is the less optically dense medium and $n_1$ is the more optically dense medium.

At angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs where no light is refracted.

## Fibre Optics
Fibre optic cables transmit light by total internal reflection.

Only light that is hitting the boundary (where the core and cladding meet) at an angle close to the normal will cross the boundary and be refracted. Each fibre optic has a very optically dense core and cladding that is much less optically dense, causing the critical angle to be very small. 

Fibre optic cables can transmit signals over long distances but due to different wavelengths being present they may arrive at the end at different times.

### Material Dispersion
This is caused by different wavelengths of light being present in the signal. To avoid this, monochromatic light can be used.
### Modal Dispersion
This is caused by the different paths signals can take within the fibre. A monomode fibre can be used (it has a very small core, ~9$\mu$m in diameter).
### Pulse Absorption
A signal may be absorbed by the material as it reflects which causes a decrease in the signals' amplitude.

Repeaters can boost the signal to counteract the effects of dispersion and absorption.
