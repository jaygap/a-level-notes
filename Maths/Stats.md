## Data collection
\
**Population $-$** the whole set of items that are of interest (e.g. people, trees, cars)

**Sampling units** $-$ individual units of a population

**Sampling frame** $-$ a list of sampling units

### Methods of data collection

**Census** $-$ observing or measuring every member of the population.

**Sample** $-$ a selection of observations taken from a subset of the population which is used to find out information about the population as a whole.

#### Sampling types

##### Random sampling

**Simple random sampling** $-$ randomly choose samples from the population.

**Systematic sampling** $-$ samples are chosen at regular intervals from an ordered list.

**Stratified sampling** $-$ the population is divided into mutually exclusive strata (groups) and a random sample is taken from each.
\
$$\textrm{no. sampled in a stratum} = \frac{\textrm{stratum size}}{\textrm{population size}} \times \textrm{overall sample size}$$

##### Non-random sampling

**Quota sampling** $-$ an interviewer selects a sample that reflects the characteristics of the whole population.

**Opportunity sampling** $-$ taking a sample from people who are available at the time of the study and who fit the criteria you are looking for.

### Types of data

**Quantitative** $-$ numerical pieces of data (e.g. height)

**Qualitative** $-$ non-numerical pieces of data (e.g. hair colour)

**Discrete** $-$ data that can only take certain values within a given range (e.g. shoe size)

**Continuous** $-$ data that can take any value within a given range (e.g. hair length)

## Measures of location and spread

### Measure of location

**Measure of location** $-$ a single value which describes a position in a data set. If the single value describes the centre of the data, it is called a measure of central tendency. The *mode*, *median*, and *mean* are all measures of central tendency.

**Mode** $-$ the sampling unit that occurs most often.

**Median** $-$ the sampling unit in the middle of the data when it is sorted.

**Mean** $-$ $\bar{x}=\frac{\Sigma x}{n}$ where $\bar{x}$ is the mean, $\Sigma x$ is the sum of all sampling units and $n$ is the number of sampling units.

**Quartiles** $-$ divide the data into 4 equal sized blocks. The *lower quartile* is $25$% of the way through the data set. The *middle quartile* is the median and $50$% of the way through the data set. The *upper quartile* is $75$% of the way though the data set.

To find the upper and lower quartiles for **discrete** data:
- Lower quartile $= n \div 4$
	- If its a whole number, the lower quartile is halfway between this data point and the one above
	- If its not a whole number, round up and choose that data point
- Upper quartile $= \frac{3}{4} \times n$
	- If its a whole number, the upper quartile is halfway between this data point and the one above
	- If its not a whole number, round up and choose that data point

**Percentiles** $-$ split the data into 100 parts such that the $10$th percentile is $10$% of the way through the data set. This means that $10$% of the data has a smaller value than the $10$th percentile, and $90$% of the data has a greater value.

### Measure of spread

**Measure of spread** $-$ a measure of how spread out the data is.

**Range** $-$ the difference between the smallest and largest data points.

**Interquartile range** $-$ the difference between the upper quartile and the lower quartile.

**Interpercentile range** $-$ the difference between the values for two given percentiles.

**Variance** $-$ $= \frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \frac{(\Sigma x)^2}{n^2}$

The variable $S_{xx}$ is sometimes seen in equations and is defined as:
\
$$S_{xx}=\Sigma x^2 - \frac{(\Sigma x)^2}{n}$$
\
**Standard deviation** $-$ the square root of variance. The symbol used to represent it is $\sigma$.
\
$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma x^2}{n} - \frac{(\Sigma x)^2}{n^2}}$$

### Coding data

Coding is a way of simplifying statistical calculations. Each data value is coded to make a new set of data values which are easier to work with.

- If data is coded using the formula $y = \frac{x - a}{b}$
	- The mean coded data is given by $\bar{y} = \frac{\bar{x} - a}{b}$
	- The standard deviation of the coded data is given by $\sigma_y = \frac{\sigma_x}{b}$

## Representations of data

An outlier is an extreme value that lies outside the overall pattern of the data. There are many different ways of calculating outliers. A common definition of an outlier is any value that is:
\
$$> Q_3 + k(Q_3 - Q_1) \textrm{ or} < Q_1 - k(Q_3 -Q_1) $$
\
There are occasions in which an outlier should be removed from the data since it is clearly an error and would be misleading to keep it in. These data values are known as **anomalies**.

The process of removing anomalies from a data set is known as cleaning the data.
